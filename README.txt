DESCRIPTION:
Before she left for work, mom told you to clean up the backyard and take out the trash. She also said that 
if you didn't do this by the time she got home, then ... well ... let's say you'd probably don't want to 
unleash her wrath.  

So hours pass and of course, you don't take out the trash. But then you get a text from mom that says, 
"I'll be home in less than five minutes! I hope you did the chores~! <3" So now, before all hell breaks 
loose, your job is to take out the trash.

HOW TO PLAY:
- Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the character 
- If the character is next to a trash heap, you can use the controls (WASD or arrow keys) to make the 
character PUSH the trash heap
- Push all the trash heaps into the squares with the diamonds on them . When a trash heap is on a square 
with a diamond, it turns into a neat little trash bag. NOTE: You can PUSH the trash bags too. 
- Get all the trash heaps to the diamond squares before  time runs out!

THINGS TO BE AWARE OF:
- There are three levels to this game. Completing one level will automatically take you to the next one,
- If you mess up, you can press C to reset. Note that resetting takes you back to the previous level.
